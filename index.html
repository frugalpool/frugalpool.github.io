<h1>frugalpool for sustainable low cost ADA staking</h1>

   <p>Ticker: FRGL </p>

   <p>don't lose your ADA to high fees </p>

   <p>We're aiming to be a strong pillar for the Cardano community and ecosystem long term. </p>
   <p>We believe in low fees but it also needs to be a sustainable business model for a stake pool operator like us, </p>
   <p>so we're trying to strike the right balance. I hope you join us on this journey. More to come as we are</p>
   <p>currently focussed on building reliable cyber infrastructure. Our aim is accomplishing 100% of the blocks assigned to us during each epoch.</p>
   <p>We have our ADA in our own pool, and it's a signficant amount, so we eat our own cooking.</p>
   <p>Starting with Epoch 12, Christmas Day, it looks like we have reliable infrastructure. Let's see how it pans out over the next days</p>
   <p>We're scheduled to produce 25 blocks today and so far we haven't missed any, unlike prior days.</p>
