<h1>frugalpool for high return on investment ADA staking (bigger is not better!) </h1>

   <p style="text-align:center"> Tickers: FRGL (40M) and FRGL1 (4M)</p>

   <p style="text-align:center"> Current return on investment for FRGL with 40 million ADA is between 14% and 21%, annualized. Please don't add much more stake to this pool because ROI will go down as overall stake gets bigger. Choose FRGL1 instead, until it reaches 40M.</p>

   <p>Our long term goal is to achieve 12% or greater annualized return for stakeholders. We have our ADA in our own pools, and it's a significant amount, so we eat our own cooking. Our approach to achieving high return will be reliable operations and communications to stakeholders about the decrease in rate of return associated with having too much stake in a pool.</p>
    <p>If stake size gets bigger the return will go down to give advantage to smaller pools. This effect comes from the algorithm intrinsic to Cardano that aims for a large number of small stake pools to have a strong and resilient ecosystem. </p>
    <p>I suggest as a rational investor you choose a pool that consistently produces a high return on investment. It doesn't need to be FRGL pool. If we're not achieving high returns you should go elsewhere. Let's keep these two pools between 35 and 45 million ADA to maximize ROI for existing stakeholders, including me ;).</p>
    <p>Since the original FRGL is max'd out on desireable stake levels FRGL1 is now online to accept stake looking for high returns, but only until it grows to 40M. If you have significant amounts of ADA (1+ million) I recommend taking a chance on operators with little to no existing stake to build a strong ecosystem for the future.</p>
    <p>Please do not use the FRGL and FRGL1 pools I created by accident (ranking numbers greater than 120) at the start during my own learning curve that have large "profit margins" but are actually large fees from a staker point of view. Daedalus rewards wallet is very misleading on the way it names the fee rate as "profit margin." Hopefully they will correct this in a future version. There are large sums of ADA in these erroneous pools. </p>
