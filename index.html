<h1>frugalpool for sustainable low cost ADA staking</h1>

   <p style="text-align:center"> Ticker: FRGL </p>

   <p style="text-align:center"> don't lose your ADA to high fees </p>

   <p>We're aiming to be a strong pillar for the Cardano community and ecosystem long term. We believe in low fees but it also needs to be a sustainable business model for stake pool operators like us, so we're trying to strike the right balance. I hope you join us on this journey. More to come as we are currently focussed on building reliable cyber infrastructure. Our aim is accomplishing 100% of the blocks assigned to us during each epoch. We have our ADA in our own pool, and it's a signficant amount, so we eat our own cooking.</p>
   <p>Starting with Epoch 12, Christmas Day, it looks like we have the first indications of having a relatively reliable infrastructure. Let's see how it pans out over the next days. We recorded 24 out of 25 scheduled blocks on the chain in Epoch 12 and lost one to another pool because of the way the consensus protocol operates. So no anomalies in this Epoch. Not bad!</p>
