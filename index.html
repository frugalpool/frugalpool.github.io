<h1>frugalpool for sustainable low cost ADA staking</h1>

   <p style="text-align:center"> Ticker: FRGL (and also FRGL1 that is just starting)</p>

   <p style="text-align:center"> don't lose your ADA to high fees; current return on investment with 40 million ADA is 21.7% annualized </p>

   <p>We're aiming to be a strong pillar for the Cardano community and ecosystem long term. We believe in low fees but it also needs to be a sustainable business model for stake pool operators like us, so we're trying to strike the right balance. I hope you join us on this journey. More to come as we are currently focussed on building reliable cyber infrastructure. Our aim is accomplishing 100% of the blocks assigned to us during each epoch. We have our ADA in our own pool, and it's a signficant amount, so we eat our own cooking.</p>
   <p>Starting with Epoch 12, Christmas Day, it looks like we have the first indications of having a relatively reliable infrastructure. Let's see how it pans out over the next days. We recorded 24 out of 25 scheduled blocks on the chain in Epoch 12 and lost one to another pool because of the way the consensus protocol operates. So no anomalies in this Epoch. Not bad!</p>
    <p>In Epoch 13 we're scheduled to produce 28 blocks!</p>
    <p>Our pool size of 40 million ADA produces a pretty high return on investment at 21.7% annualized. If it gets bigger the return is supposed to go down to give advantage to smaller pools. Will be interesting to see how it changes. It also means I should probably create more pools rather than grow this one.  Have a look at FRGL1 but not the ones I created by mistake. Look for the one that produces one block per Epoch. </p>
    <p>Suggest you choose a pool that is small and consistently produces at high return on investment. Doesn't need to be FRGL pool. There are others that look good to me. Let's keep this one around 40 million ADA or maybe a bit less to maximize ROI.</p>
